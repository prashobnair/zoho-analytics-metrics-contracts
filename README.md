# zoho-analytics-metrics-contracts (moved)

This project moved to [zoho-implementation-toolkit](https://github.com/prashobnair/zoho-implementation-toolkit) as the `metrics` module. Its full commit history was preserved there.

It checks cross-app metric definitions and freshness, so finance, sales, and operations read from the same contract.

## Use it now

```sh
pip install https://github.com/prashobnair/zoho-implementation-toolkit/releases/download/v0.1.0/zohokit-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

or

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/prashobnair/zoho-implementation-toolkit@v0.1.0
```

The old `python cli.py tables.json [--audience sales]` is now:

```sh
zohokit metrics check tables.json [--audience sales]
```

Audience-specific output keeps each team on its own metrics. Reports render with `--format json|table|markdown|html` and `--out`.
